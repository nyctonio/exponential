# My Orders

**My Orders** is the screen where the user can see the orders that he has placed.

**Note :** A limit order is a type of order placed by an investor to buy or sell a security (such as stocks, bonds, or commodities) at a specified price or better. When you place a limit order to buy, you set the maximum price you are willing to pay. Conversely, when you place a limit order to sell, you set the minimum price you are willing to accept.

**How to place a limit order** :
On the **Perform trades** screen , you can select the order type to be **limit** and then you can set the price in the trigger price input.

There are some options at the top where you can filter on the basis of **exchange name**, search for a **particular scriptname** and can select the **date range** for the orders that the user has placed.

#### My Orders table

This table contains the user's orders that he has performed. Each row of the table contains the information about each position/trade.

**The row includes :** Script Name, Exchange name, Trade Type, Trade Status , Buy Price, Sell price, trades unrelalized P/L, current buy and sell prices, Sell and buy lots and the **trade amount**.

**Optional :**

- If you want to buy shares of a company but only if the price falls to ₹50 or below, you would place a buy limit order with a limit price of ₹50. If the market price reaches or falls below ₹50, your order will be executed, but if the price remains above ₹50, your order will not be filled.

- Similarly, if you own shares of a company and want to sell them at ₹70 or higher, you would place a sell limit order with a limit price of ₹70. If the market price rises to or above ₹70, your order will be executed, but if the price stays below ₹70, your order will not be filled.

- Limit orders provide traders with more control over the price at which their trades are executed, but there is a risk that the order may not be filled if the market price does not reach the specified limit.
