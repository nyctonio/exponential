**Optional:**

- Positions can be opened and closed through trading activities. Opening a position involves entering into a trade by either buying or selling an asset, while closing a position involves exiting the trade by selling or buying back the asset. The difference between the price at which a position is opened and the price at which it is closed determines the profit or loss on the trade.
