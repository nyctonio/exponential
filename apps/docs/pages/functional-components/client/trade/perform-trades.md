# Perform Trades

**Perform Trades** is the screen where you can actually perform the trades.

It has the following functionalities.

**1. Search and add scripts** :
At the top there are two options. First one is a **dropdown** to change the exchange name i.e., between **NSE** and **MCX**.
Along with it, there is a search script option where you can search and select the scripts based on the exchange name selected that you want to add in the watchlist.

At last you have a **Add** button on which you can click to add the scripts you selected in your watchlist.

There are two columns named **buy price** and **sell price** which shows the current buy and sell price. If the user clicks on that prices then a modal is opened to buy or sell that particular stock.

**Buy/Sell Modal** : The trade modal includes multiple things

1. Script Name, current buy price , current sell price, lot size, change (in %).
2. Then there is order type **Market or Limit**. A toggle button for **intraday** which is visible to only those clients who are allowed to trade in intraday.
3. At last we have number of lots the user wants to trade on and there is a **trigger price** which is used to place a limit order **(can add less that or equal to maximum number of lots allowed by its upline)**.
