# Docs Intro

Let's discover **Exponential Docs in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **adding a file in /docs**.

Or **explore in github** with **[github.com](https://github.com/lifeasesolutions/Alpen.Exponential.Docs)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd Alpen.Exponential.Docs
pnpm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `pnpm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
